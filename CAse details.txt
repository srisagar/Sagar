Subject: USCIS Case no MSC1691081942-- Delay in Renewal of my EAD (Employment Authorization Document), Past the processing time of 90 days

Respected Sir/Madam,
I have applied to the USCIS for renewing my EAD (Employment Authorization document) on 05/18/2016. I have received a receipt with case no MSC1691081942 on 05/20/2016.
Since then I have no correspondence from the USCIS office regarding my case.
My current EAD expires on 09/04/2016. Hence if I don't get a renewal by then, I will be out of employment. This will potentially cause severe financial problems for my family and myself.
Please do the needful to expedite my case with the USCIS.

Case Details:
Issue: Renewal of EAD--No response after more than 90 days of the receipt date
EAD Category: C9
A-Number : A08943995
Receipt No: MSC1691081942

Please feel free to contact me on the Phone number mentioned below for more information
Thanks for all your help in advance.

Sincerely,
